# Welcome to Musala API

## Quick Setup

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
     npm i --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

2. Run the project

    ``` bash
     npm run dev
    ```

3. Test this project with postman, all routes are declared in the gateway.route.ts file

## Explanation

1. This project was developed to look at separation of concerns by having the models, routers, and services in different places.

2. We did not use any external package like nest, nor did we have any connection to any Database, as I am not a backend Developer and
    there was little time

3. Nodemon was installed to automatically update changes

## Blockers

1. Because I did not use any other external file, I kept having CORS error from my frontend

2. I would have found a way to fix this, but unfortunately, work is the busiest around this time of the year, and I dont want to keep delaying.

3. P.S its almost Christmas, so happy Holidays in advance
